  My name is Michael Golshani and I am a software engineer with a passion for creating products that can make a meaningful impact on people's lives.


  With previous experience as a mechanical engineer, and ecommerce brand building, my story has come full circle now actually building software products that I used to use. 

  If you are interested in connecting, let's chat! I love to connect and grow with like-minded individuals. 

  Currently, open for work as well!
